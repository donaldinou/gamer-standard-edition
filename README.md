### Use Composer (*recommended*)

As it uses [Composer][2] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, use the `create-project` command to generate a new Nuked Klan application:

    php composer.phar create-project nuked-klan/gamer-standard-edition path/to/install

Composer will install Nuked Klan and all its dependencies under the
`path/to/install` directory.

### Download an Archive File

To quickly test the CMS, you can also download this [archive][3], or this [one][32]
of the Gamer Edition and unpack it somewhere under your web server root directory.


3) Browsing into the install directory
---------------------------------------

Now, you need to parameter your database.
In order to do it, just start your web browser and go to the following address:
("yoursite.com" replace your web address)

    http://www.yourwebsite.com/INSTALL/

Select the desired language and click on the submit button.
Choose the desired installation mode “installation with assistance”
(recommended for novices) or “speed installation”.
